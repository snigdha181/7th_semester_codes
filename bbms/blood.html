                <h5>Blood</h5>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood" target="_blank">Blood</a> is one of the most important components of life. Almost any animal that possesses a circulatory system has blood. From an evolutionary perspective, blood was speculated to have risen from a type of cell that was responsible for phagocytosis and nutrition. Billions of years later, blood and the circulatory system have drastically helped the evolution of more complex lifeforms.
                    Blood is a fluid connective tissue that consists of plasma, blood cells and platelets. It circulates throughout our body delivering oxygen and nutrients to various cells and tissues. It makes up 8% of our body weight. An average adult possesses around 5-6 litres of blood.

                <h5>Understanding your lab test results</h5>
                <p>
                    When you have cancer, you will probably need regular lab, imaging, or other tests. Blood tests are done to help watch your body’s response to treatment. They can show small changes before problems get serious. Keeping track of your lab results lets your doctor take action as soon as your blood counts change to help prevent many cancer-related problems and cancer treatment side effects. The two most common types of lab tests are the complete blood count (CBC) and the chemistry panel or metabolic profile. <br>
                    Sometimes, you might see your lab test results before you have a chance talk about what they mean with your health care team. This can cause worry, especially if the results are unclear or seem to show something abnormal. Talking to the health care provider who is ordering the tests ahead of time might help. Here are some things you might ask about:

What results you might expect, where you can get them, and when they might be available
What a normal or abnormal result is and what it might mean for you
When and how they will contact you to discuss your results
Who to call if you see results first and have concerns about them﻿

                <h5>Blood donation process</h5>
                <p>
                    The blood donation process from the time you arrive until the time you leave takes about an hour. The donation process itself is only about 8-10 minutes on average.
